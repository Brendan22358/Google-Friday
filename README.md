Project- Object based Calculator Create a calculator that can have multiple bells and whistles and allow the user to input parenthesis. Hopefully I can figure out how to do the more advanced things such as roots.  -first user input, will there have to be a certain format   -making functions to do different mathematical functions  -making functions to represent inputs  -creating a visual  -creating buttons that a user can interact with on the visual  -having the function work in real time (doesnâ€™t show visuals up constantly, like have multiple images scrolling I want only the part in the screen to change while the buttons stay still (not scrolling))
